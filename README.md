# rt-smallresources V.1.0.1
qb-smallresources edited to work with ox_inventory
edited for personal use but decided to release, there are more things removed then just what conflicts

If your using ps-hud you will need to change the export in the client lua from qb-smallresources to rt-smallresources or rename the script back to qb-smallresources
